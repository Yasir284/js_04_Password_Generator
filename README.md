# JavaScript Color changer project

- This is Javascript mini-Project. In this project I have made a **Random Password generator** with JavasCript, which generates random password everytime.

- You can also specify what type of character you want like uppercase alphabets, lowercase alphabets, numbers and symbols.

- You can specify length of the password and also can copy the password to your **clipboard**

- I have also added a surprise to it, so do check it out. The live link is given below.

- It took me 5-6 hrs to make this project.
